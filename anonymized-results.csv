- Impressive educational background with relevant knowledge to management studied at university. 
- 8 years of high end on the job experience. Clearly capable at his her job and has a lot of experience to back up the studies she has done in the past.
- Clearly motivated to grow and improve any companies/business she is employed under. A real asset to any company.

Cons
- She is a women so others not take her very seriously. A serious sexism issue in society that can't be resolved so easily. The bias can possibly hamper her performance.
- While 8 years of experience is a lot, there may be other candidates with much greater amount of experience that can trump her experience.
- She has lots of public relation experience which may or may not translate over well to management. She has project management experience for at least half of her career i.e. 4 years, but that may not be enough to fill the needs of your company.

- She has lots of work experience. 8 years worth at least. In this 8 years she managed to work for the prestigious group alliant for roughly half a decade.
- Useful educational background that may help her in management consultant for your company. A master in business could be useful to allow her to give you powerful insight in how your company operates and how it can improve. She has also industrial management knowledge which boosts her skill set even to greater heights.  
- Based on the statistical information available on the resume, we can assume she knows how to manage company to make money and profits. Her resume indicates that she is very specific about her accomplishments.

Cons
- While she does work for a prestigious group now. Her previous 3 jobs before Alliant was a complete wash. While on paper she has 8 years of experience, the 3 jobs from 2007 - 2012 might as well be no experience considering how utterly worthless those experiences were. It almost looks like fluff just to make her resume look longer. 
- She is a women, so biases against her for being a women can be a problem in a management consulting position. 
- She uses hotmail, a very impersonal email which is telling of her technological experience. This may or may not impact her work as a management consultant. ",80,25,165000,4,1,1,parent,sarah,

It is entirely possible these seemingly good projects go south and both us and the company she worked for are stuck operating sub-optimally.  She has also only done her previous job for one employer and as such may have been a big fish in a smaller pond and may be over performing due to gravely poor performance of those that came before her.
